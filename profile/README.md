# WLU Muslim Student's Association Repository 

This project is the official page for Laurier's Muslim Student Association. It was developed to serve the Muslim community at Wilfrid Laurier University by the permission of Allah.
We wanted to keep our projects open source so that other MSA's or ISOC's can use them as a point of reference when developing their website. 
We do ask however, that if you are going to use our website please reach out we would love to collaborate and exchange ideas with your team Inshallah.
